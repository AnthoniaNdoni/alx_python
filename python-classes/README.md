Python - Classes and Objects
This repository git clone https://github.com/AnthoniaNdoni/alx-python
  contains examples and explanations related to the concept of Classes and Objects in Python. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that allows you to model real-world entities and their interactions in a structured manner. This repository explores how to define classes, create objects, and utilize the principles of OOP in Python.

Introduction to Classes and Objects
Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming. They allow you to define the structure and behavior of objects. An object is an instance of a class, which holds data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods).

Defining a Class
A class is defined using the class keyword. It consists of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that define the behavior of the class. Here's a simple example of a class definition:

Creating Objects
Once a class is defined, you can create objects (instances) of that class using the class constructor. Here's how to create an instance of the Dog class.

Instance Attributes and Methods
Objects have attributes that store data and methods that define their behavior. Attributes are accessed using dot notation, and methods are called using parentheses.

Private Attributes and Encapsulation
Python supports encapsulation by allowing you to make attributes private using a double underscore prefix (__). Private attributes are not meant to be accessed directly from outside the class. They are accessed using name mangling. 
    
Inheritance and Polymorphism
Inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass) that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass). Polymorphism enables different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a shared interface.

Class Documentation
Documenting your classes is essential for code readability. Use docstrings to provide explanations of the class purpose, attributes, methods, and usage.
    """A class to represent a circle."
Module Documentation
Document your module by adding a description at the beginning of your .py file. This helps others understand the purpose and contents of the module.

Python - Classes and Objects Module

This module provides examples and explanations related to classes and objects
in Python. It covers class definitions, object creation, attributes, methods,
encapsulation, inheritance, and more.
"""
By combining these elements, you can create well-structured and well-documented classes and objects in Python. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding and applying OOP principles using classes and objects.
